# ThingScope
**ThingScope** is a set of tools that complement each other to analyze home network for informing consumers about security and privacy-related behavior of home
internet of things (IoT) devices, such as security cameras, thermostats, smart TV and smart
speakers, both pre-purchase and when the device is installed in their home.

This project is used for an applied research course offered in Spring and Fall terms.
