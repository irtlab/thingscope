Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been widely implemented across different environments,
such as smart homes, smart cities, and various business networks. Examples of IoT devices include
smart speakers like Amazon Echo Dot, smart cameras, and smart light bulbs. They significantly
enhance our daily lives and communities by boosting convenience, efficiency, and quality.
Although IoT devices only provide limited functions and communicate with a finite number of
endpoints, they present numerous challenges in terms of security management due to the vast
range of manufacturers and operating modes, along with their low cost, resulting in vulnerable
firmware. This project aims to develop a security gateway to identify IoT devices within a network
using traffic data and Internet Protocol (IP) utilities, enabling the gateway to recognize each device
and retrieve their corresponding Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) profiles.
