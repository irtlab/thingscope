This dataset was used for experiments regarding IoT device-type identification in the IEEE ICDCS 2017 publication "IoT SENTINEL: Automated Device-Type Identification for Security Enforcement in IoT" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04880).
It represents the traffic emitted during the setup of 31 smart home IoT devices of 27 different types (4 types are represented by 2 devices each). Each setup was repeated at least 20 times per device-type.
Each directory contains several pcap files, each representing a setup of the given device directory. Files are named Setup-X-Y-STA.pcap where X is the person realizing the setup and Y is the sequence number of the given capture. The file _iotdevice-mac.txt contains the MAC address of the considered IoT device.
